# Windows Registry Modification Script

This script allows you to make modifications to the Windows Registry by importing a `.reg` file. The `.reg` file contains a set of registry keys and values that will be added or modified in the registry.

## Usage

1. Double-click the saved `.reg` file to import the registry changes.
2. You may be prompted to confirm the changes. Click "Yes" or "OK" to proceed.
3. After the registry modifications have been applied, it is recommended to **restart your system** for the changes to take effect.

## Note

- Modifying the Windows Registry can have a significant impact on system behavior and stability. Ensure that you have a backup of your registry or create a system restore point before applying any changes.
- Always verify the source and content of the `.reg` file before importing it. Malicious or incorrect modifications to the registry can cause system issues.
- Some registry modifications may require administrative privileges. Make sure you run the script with appropriate permissions.
- It is essential to **restart your system** after applying registry modifications to ensure that the changes are fully implemented.
